            <h2>About Him</h2>
            <p>
                Stephen Ray Vaughan (October 3, 1954 - August 27, 1990) was an American musician, singer, songwriter,
                and record producer, best known as the guitarist and frontman of the blues rock trio Stevie Ray Vaughan
                and Double Trouble. Although his mainstream career only spanned seven years, he is regarded as one of
                the most influential musicians in the history of blues music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all
                time.

                Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his
                elder brother, Jimmie Vaughan. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin, where he
                began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan joined forces with Tommy
                Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums as Double Trouble in 1978 and established it as part of the
                Austin music scene; it soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. He performed at the Montreux
                Jazz Festival in 1982, where David Bowie saw him play and contacted him for a studio gig, resulting in
                Stevie playing his blues guitar on the album Let's Dance (1983), before being discovered by John
                Hammond, who interested major label Epic Records in signing Vaughan and his band to a record deal.
                Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album Texas Flood.
                With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became
                the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s. Playing his guitar behind his back or plucking the
                strings with his teeth as Jimi Hendrix did, he earned fame in Europe, which later resulted in
                breakthroughs for guitar players like Robert Cray, Jeff Healey, Robben Ford and Walter Trout, amongst
                others.</p>
